title: Recent Changes in Google Search Results 
---

Over the past week or so, many have noticed a lot of fluctuation in the search engine results. Some are suggesting that this is due to the typical holiday season shuffling which has been noticed in the past. Some webmasters have even claimed that their sites have lost rankings in the last couple weeks due to algorithim changes. 

Despite the ramblings about algorithim changes around Christmas time, there doesn't seem to be much proof of it. Reviewing the info posted on algoroo.com for the past month, it doesn't appear that anything major is aloof. The only real fluctuation we see is what we referred to before about the [December 15th change](http://capitol-seo.com/2016/12/24/possible-google-update.html) .  The rest of the month of December (and early January) appears to be faireye on ly calm in terms of fluctuation. We believe that nothing major is happening in terms of algorithm changes. We will have to keep an eye out for anything else.
