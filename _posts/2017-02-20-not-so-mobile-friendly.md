title: Google Labels Mobile-Friendly Sites as Unfriendly!
---

So Google made a big deal about the mobile friendly checkup on their site to help people understand how to improve their site. Mobile friendly sites are supposed to be getting better search results with the latest mobile update. However, if people are unable to understand how to make their site mobile friendly according to Google standards, then it could be impossible to comply. Some people who had worked hard to make mobile and AMP sites even found that they got dissed by the G. 

Fortunately, just because your site isn't getting the mobile friendly tag from Google as of yet doesn't mean it's the truth. Google has had some errors reviewing sites for mobile compliance. This is going to be fixed soon according to what we have read. Therefore, if you think your site is not mobile, you may be wrong. You might have already done all the hard work!
