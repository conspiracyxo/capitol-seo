title: Another Possible Search Update 
---

## Volatile Search Results in March 2017 
We've seen a lot of activity in the SERPS this year. We had the [Penguin 4.0](http://capitol-seo.com/2016/09/23/penguin-4.0-update.html) roll out, a possible mobile search update, and another recent update aimed at unnecessary pop-ups. However, it looks like things are heating up again in March! Around March 7th or 8th many SEOs and webmasters began noticing a lot of changes in the search results. 

The middle and end of February actually looked pretty calm according to most trusted trackers. Yet, when we got to the end of the first week of March, we started seeing a lot of chatter as seen below...

The movement seemed to be equally noticeable in both the desktop and mobile search formats. Other trackers such as [Google Grump](https://www.accuranker.com/grump/) also seemed to confirm this with a consistent "furious" mood over that last few days...

So the question remains, what the hell is going on now? 

## No Clear Answers Yet 
We did a quick survey with some of our colleagues, and reviewed the musings of some of the well known SEOs to find out what this is all about. To our dismay, there isn't a lot of info available yet. There is, however, a lot of speculation as webmasters try to figure out how to respond to this rude awakening. Some seem to think it is an attack on PBN networks. Others think it is addressing backlink profiles in general. Most of the sites we work with have not seen any major changes, so we currently do not have any proprietary data to go on. 

Some well known bloggers and rankers went straight to the source (Google) and asked what was going on. As you can expect, the response from J. Mueller and Illyes was rather cryptic. Mueller just stated that the webspam team makes "changes every day," avoiding any comment on the current state of affairs. Illyes claimed that the new update was called "Fred." Clearly both gentlemen were keeping tight lipped about anything going on behind the scenes.

## In Summary
It is undeniable that something is going on here with the search results. We have noticed several spammy pages rising up in certain searches. Other websites that seem to have a natural backlink pattern seemed to have suffered. One thing that is clear is that this change is looking at linking patterns. Whether it is a part of Penguin 4.0 or a new update altogether, it needs to be watched very closely. We have some of our own ideas how to deal with this (which we won't share here) but if you would like a consultation regarding your site, contact us for more info.
