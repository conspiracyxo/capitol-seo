## Google Will Soon Release a Primary Mobile Search Index
First of all, this is huge news! G plans on creating another whole search index that will be served to mobile devices. This means that there will be two versions of the tech giant's search index: the old desktop version, and the new mobile version. Very soon we might began to see different search results depending on the medium you are using! 

The news came direclty from Gary Illyes during his [keynote speech at Pubcon](http://www.pubcon.com/keynote-gary-illyes-pubcon-las-vegas-2016) in Las Vegas. Gary explained that in the current situation, G ranks sites in the mobile search index based on their ranking signals in the desktop version. This apparently created some problems as many mobile sites are not structured the same as their desktop counterparts. Illyes said that it makes more sense to create a separate index because the index system had problems ranking two sites with identical content. 

The other amazing news related to this topic is that the mobile index will now become Google's main index! The desktop version will be the "secondary" index, meaning that it will get a little less TLC in terms of updates and refreshes. To top it all off, Illyes mentioned that the dawn of this new index is just months away! This means that we could be using this index in early 2017 whenever we search from a smartphone or tablet.
