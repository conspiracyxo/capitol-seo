# Google Will Soon Release a Primary Mobile Search Index

First of all, this is huge news! G plans on creating another whole search index that will be served to mobile devices. This means that there will be two versions of the tech giant’s search index: the old desktop version, and the new mobile version. Very soon we might began to see different search results depending on the medium you are using!

## A Mobile Index? Says Who?

The news came direclty from Gary Illyes during his [keynote speech at Pubcon](http://www.pubcon.com/keynote-gary-illyes-pubcon-las-vegas-2016) in Las Vegas. Gary explained that in the current situation, G ranks sites in the mobile search index based on their ranking signals in the desktop version. This apparently created some problems as many mobile sites are not structured the same as their desktop counterparts. Illyes said that it makes more sense to create a separate index because the index system had problems ranking two sites with identical content.

The other amazing news related to this topic is that the mobile index will now become Google’s main index! The desktop version will be the “secondary” index, meaning that it will get a little less TLC in terms of updates and refreshes. The reason for the big switch is that 85% of searches are now being made from mobile devices. Thus, it makes sense for G to focus on the more popular method of searching. However, this is not all the news we got. To top it all off, Illyes mentioned that the dawn of this new index is just months away! This means that we could be using this index in early 2017 whenever we search from a smartphone or tablet.

## What This Means for the Average Webmaster

If you have a personal website or a site for your business, you’ll need to step up your mobile game! The new index will likely run on a different type of algorithim than the desktop version. As such, it will count a different set of signals in order to figure out which sites should be ranking at the top. We think the signals used will be something akin to the mobile updates which were deployed on the desktop search version. The last [Google mobile update](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/03/continuing-to-make-web-more-mobile.html) that we know of happened somewhere around May of 2016. This update gave a boost to sites that were termed “mobile friendly.” G has since dropped the use of the mobile friendly terminology, perhaps because they are integrating its engine into the new search index.

In the end, sites will have to be better adapted to the mobile environment. For example, if you are using structured data to produce rich snippets on your main site version, you’re going to want to add it to your mobile site as well. Today, with responsive design at the helm of modern website creation, a desktop site and mobile site are usually one in the same. Yet, all these sites will have to be retrofitted in some way to ensure that they are truly mobile optimized. We can help make sure your site meets the needs the of mobile user.
