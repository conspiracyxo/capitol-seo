_Google may have updated the index again!_ 

### Search Engine Trackers Show Significant Activity on Dec. 15th

The search engine tracker, algoroo.com, showed a lot of activity on the 15th of this month. Many are assuming this is due to another clandestine update by the "Big G." According to various news sites, the company has been under fire for some of its seach results which list racist websites. In particular, the subject area in question revolved around queries asking whether the Holocaust really happened. Google searches for this term had previously brought up denial sites towads the top of the results. Many people were upset with this, and rightfully so! Despite a plethora of information which has confirmed the occurrence of the Holocaust, some denial sites have popped up on the net which spread inaccurate information. This goes against Google's promise to provide the best "authority" in response to queries for this type of information. 

In response, Google allegedly unleashed an update to remove racist sites such as the one in question. Initially, this update caused a little confusion in the results for the above referenced search term. The site complained of still would appear towards the top of the results for some users. Eventually, the site in question disappeared from the search results. In our recent query, the first site listed is now an article by an SEO blog discussing the controversy over this event. 

Therefore, it is clear an update did occur to address the listing of a controversial site. All in all, we are glad to see this type of update occur so that truthful information is available to search users rather than unfounded assumptions.
