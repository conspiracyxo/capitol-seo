  <section class="post-content"><p>Meta tags are very important in the search optimization world. These are the first signals to search engines that advise what the site is about. One meta tag in particular, the meta description, is a key component of a successful online campaign. It must be filled out correctly if you want it to have the maximum effect for your site.</p>

<p>The meta description tag is the little blurb that shows under the URL line in a search engine result. It is the first piece of content that potential visitors see when they pull up the results. As such, you need to make sure it is accurate, intriguing, and enticing enough for the user to click through.</p>

<p>Meta descriptions are limited to 160 characters. This is not a lot of space to play around with. You will need to be creative and concise at the same time. Some good rules to follow are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use an active voice - This inspires action on the user’s behalf. It also makes the description sound fresh and exciting.</li>
  <li>Don’t click bait - Promising things in the meta description that people can’t really find on the site will make your bounce rate high. This is bad!</li>
  <li>Use your targeted keyword - Your meta description should have your keyword somewhere in it. This will help identify what your site is about.</li>
  <li>Tell the user what to do - Is is a great idea to tell a user how to benefit from using your site. A simple “learn more here” or “contact us today” tells the user what you want them to do with the information. It also makes it seem like a real person is behind the website.</li>
  <li>Use structured content if applicable - If you sell products, it’s a good idea to use structured content to give specific info about your product. People might want to know if the page will be about a specific model number, or is offered at a certain price.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take time with your meta description so that people get the best first impression about your site. It’s really your first and only chance to get someone to check out your website. Don’t alienate potential visitors. Engage them on the spot so they will want to choose your site over all the others listed!</p>
