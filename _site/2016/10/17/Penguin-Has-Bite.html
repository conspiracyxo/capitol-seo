<p>When <a href="http://capitol-seo.com/2016/09/23/penguin-4.0-update.html">Penguin 4.0</a> first came out (just a week or so ago) it looked promising. At first glance, it seemed like it could be a pretty fair update. First, it was said to be granular, meaning that only specific pages would be affected if link manipulation occurred. Second, it was said to devalue instead of demote like Panda does. Overall, it seemed like it might not be too bad.</p>

<p>Now that a little time has passed we are learning what Penguin is really about. At his latest appearance on the 3rd day of pubcon, Gary Illyes talked about a few things worth mentioning. One of these is the idea that Penguin can effectually demote a site if given the reason to. Illyes stated that where there appears to be a pattern of link manipulation, the G-Team can devalue all the links in one fell swoop. Talk about throwing out the baby with the bathwater!</p>

<p>So far it is unclear whether the “mass devaluation” will occur on the affected url or the site as a whole. We suppose that the granular effect of Penguin 4.0 would limit it to the url in question. Either way, it is a scary thing to think about.</p>

<h2 id="the-invitation-to-negative-seo">The Invitation to Negative SEO</h2>
<p>Penguin 4.0 seemed to resolve one big problem that occurs in the search optimization field: negative SEO. This concept involves one competitor intentionally spamming the site of another in order to prompt a penalty. Doing so would basically get the competition out of the way so that one’s site could occupy a higher position in the rankings. Penguin 4.0’s use of devaluation instead of demotion made it a lot harder to <em>neg SEO</em> someone because the extra links would basically be valueless instead of penalty inducing.</p>

<p>Now, it seems that someone could <em>neg SEO</em> a site and trick G into thinking that the site owner is doing it. Theoretically, in this scenario G could devalue all the sites links, even the powerful ones that are maintaining the site’s ranking. Obviously, this would send the site into search engine limbo. We suppose the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en">disavow tool</a> could still come in handy here, but who knows to what extent and when. Furthermore, the fact that Penguin 4.0 runs in real time means that your site could get dumped even before you get a chance to react.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>What we can take from this is that black hat SEO is a real gamble with today’s version of Penguin. We also note that webmasters must continually monitor their sites for suspicious activity from unknown sources. We don’t know the full story about this yet, but it sure is a wake-up call for anyone concerned about their site’s well-being.</p>
