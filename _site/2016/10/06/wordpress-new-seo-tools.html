<p>The people over at <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> have just made Wordpress all the better! Those how have a wordpress.com business account will now have acces to <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/attract-more-visitors-to-your-business-site-with-our-advanced-seo-tools/">advanced SEO tools</a> that will help your site rank higher. The new features will make Wordpress.com blogs more like self-hosted sites which use one of the many available plug-ins, such as Yoast. Check out the new features below.</p>

<h3 id="custom-title-tags">Custom Title Tags</h3>

<p>Title tags might be the most important meta-tag out there. This is the short description (usually 70-71 characters) that shows at the top of the browser bar when you visit a site. If you are confused as to where this is, take a look at the top of our site which should start off with <a href="https://capitol-seo.com">“Sacramento SEO Expert…” </a> This tag is critical to SEO success because search engines often refer to it in order to find out what the page is about.</p>

<p>In the past, title tags have been abused and subject to over-optimization penalties. Nowadays, it’s a lot smarter to use proper title tags that truly benefit readers of the site.</p>

<p>This feature was previously not editable on Wordpress.com sites, and it will bring a big change for the bloggers and website owners that work exclusively on the .com version of WP.</p>

<h3 id="meta-description-controls">Meta Description Controls</h3>

<p>As with title tags, you were not able to edit meta descriptions on previous versions of wp.com. Meta descriptions are the brief explanations that show under the site address in search results. These are great for SEO because they can encompass certain keywords that a site is trying to rank for, and therefore produce better rankings. Formerly, search engines pulled text (from an article) which it thought was relevant to present in the results. Basically, the site owner had no control of how the description would be presented to potential readers. Now, you have the ability to tell readers what you want to about the site, and you can also squeeze in some important terms to get your site in the right search results.</p>

<h3 id="social--search-previews">Social &amp; Search Previews</h3>

<p>Another really cool feature is the ability to view how your site will look in search and social listings. This will help site owner see their site from another perspective and modify it to their liking. This makes wp.com much more social friendly than it already is, and provides a much better user experience.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>

<p>Wordpress.com is a great option for people who don’t want to deal with the management invovled in a self-hosted site. Wp.com servers are great, and the fact that they are expertly managed for you (for free) means that you can concentrate on your website instead of dealing with hosting issues. Using Wordpress thorugh the .com site is an ideal scenario for start-ups or small businesses that want to stay secure and efficient.</p>

<p>The main drawback to Wordpress.com in the past was that one sacrificed control over SEO optimization. That has now changed. I think a lot of new users will be heading down this route due to the ease of use and reliabilty that the .com site offers. If you are interested in this as an option for your site, contact us. We have worked extensively with both Wordpress.com and self-hosted WP sites, and we can get you up and running in no time!</p>
